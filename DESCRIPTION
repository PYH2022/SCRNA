Description: 
    Single cell RNA sequencing provides gene expression profile of individual cells. Single Cell Transcriptomics Analysis is aimed to characterize cell states and identify cellular heterogeneity.
    The input data collected from single cell transcriptomic measurements is primarily a matrix, with each row representing a cell and each column representing a gene. 
    The data analysis workflow is roughly divided into five steps, including pre-processing (quality control), dimension reduction (PCA, UMAP), CLustering (K-means, Louvain), Annotation, Downstream Verification.
    Above all, SCRNA give a simple implementation of functions and methods in the single cell transcriptomics data analysis workflow.
